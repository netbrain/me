So I came over this static site generator built using go, and i just couldn't resist to try it. And after a couple of hours of tweaking, customising and banging my head on the wall, I had successfully created my a proper blog and even imported a [blog entry](/post/a-simple-todo-application-tradition-vs-cqrs+es "a-simple-todo-application-tradition-vs-cqrs+es") I had written for my employer's blog [bouvet](http://www.bouvet.no/en/ "bouvet") (Which by the way is a great norwegian based IT consultant company!)

But anyways, don't expect much from this blog/site. I'm not really that active, atleast i don't think I am. But if I happen to be in the mood and feel that i have something substantial to say then maybe ill post a thing or two. 

No promises though.
