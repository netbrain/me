So I came over this static [site generator](http://gohugo.io/) built using [go](http://golang.org), and i just couldn't resist to try it. And after a couple of hours of tweaking, customising and banging my head on the wall, I had successfully created my a proper blog and even imported a [blog entry](/post/a-simple-todo-application-tradition-vs-cqrs+es "a-simple-todo-application-tradition-vs-cqrs+es") I had written for [bouvet](http://www.bouvet.no/en/ "bouvet"), my current employer, which in my opinion is a great place to work.

But anyways, don't expect much from this blog/site. I'm not really that active, atleast I don't think I am. But if I happen to be in the mood and feel that I have something substantial to say then maybe ill post a thing or two. 

No promises though.
